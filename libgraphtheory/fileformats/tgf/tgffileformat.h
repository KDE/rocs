/** \brief class TgfFileFormatPlugin: Import and Export Plugin for TGF
 *
 * This plugin class allows reading and writing of Trivial Graph Format (TGF) files.
 * TGF is a simple file format that can store directed graphs by a list of nodes and list of edges.
 * Each node and each edge can have exactly one label.
 *
 * Format Specification:
 *  - The file starts with a list of nodes (one node per line), followed by a line with the only
 *    character "#", followed by a list of edges (one edge per line).
 *  - A node consists of an integer (identifier), followed by a space, followed by an arbitrary string.
 *  - An edge consists of two integers (identifiers) separated by a space, followed by a space,
 *    followed by an arbitrary string. It is assumed that the directed edge points from the first
 *    identifier to the second identifier.
