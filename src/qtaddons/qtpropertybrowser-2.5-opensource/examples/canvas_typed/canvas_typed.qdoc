    \title Type Based Canvas Example

    This example demonstrates how to use different
    QtAbstractPropertyManager subclasses for different property
    types. Using this approach, the developer interfaces with a
    type-safe API (since each manager has its own property-type
    specific API).

    \image canvas_typed.png

    The example presents a canvas filled up with items of different
    types, and a tree property browser which displays the currently
    selected item's properties.

    All item types has a few common properties like "Position X", "Position Y"
    or "Position Z", but each type also adds its own type-specific
    properties (e.g. the text items provide "Text" and "Font"
    properties, and the line items provide a "Vector" property).

    The source files can be found in examples/canvas_typed directory
    of the package.
