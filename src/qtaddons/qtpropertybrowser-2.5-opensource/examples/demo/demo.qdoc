    \title Demo Example

    This example shows how to customize a property browser widget's
    appearance and behavior.

    \image demo.png

    The various property browsers presented in this example display
    the same set of properties, and are implementations of the
    QtTreePropertyBrowser class and the QtGroupBoxPropertyBrowser
    class, respectively. 

    The example shows how a property browser's appearance and behavior can
    be varied using the QtPropertyBrowser framework's property
    managers and editor factories.

    The source files can be found in examples/demo directory of the package.
