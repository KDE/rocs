Basic Installation
==================

These are generic installation instructions.

First, download the released tar.gz source files from http://download.kde.org or fetch the project 
by GIT from https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kdeedu/rocs. 
Second, cf. to http://techbase.kde.org/Projects/Edu/Rocs on how to configure your system.
Third, run Rocs by running the binary "rocs".

Alternatively, all major Linux distributions (and also the KDE on Windows Project) ship
precompiled versions of the latest release Rocs.
