- Port from QtScript to Kross 
- Nice Animations on inserting and deleting nodes and edges.
- a Node.moveTo(x, y) method that will animate things.
- LinkedList and DoubleLinkedList objects on the script part for linked list visualization of the manipulation (confusing?)

     l = newLinkedList(linkedList.ordered)
     l.append(1); // an node gracefully fades in on the scene
     l.append(3); // an node gracefully fades and search for it's location on the scene.
     l.append(5); // ditto.
     l.remove(3); // 3 is gracefully removed, with an fade out, and a new edge is connected between 1 and 5.

- Trees.
