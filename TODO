Shortcut Keys everywyere, please.

17 NOVEMBER 2008

1 - Save / Load Graph files missing from core/graphDocument.
  The File Format used for graphs will be GraphML - http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/
  an KAction should be created on UI_MainWindow.cpp and inserted on the KActionCollection of the GUI,
  the Rocsui.rc should be modified to load the save / load files on the menubar. 
  
2 - Create / Save / Load / Everything about Scripts are not done yet.
  I did some initial code but the script was integrated with the graph, after a long talk with the maintaner of the java-only version of Rox he removed that Idea from my head. 
  Probably create a new file named scriptHandler.{h, cpp} and put the code there, 
  integrate it on UI_GraphEdit.{h,cpp} ( GraphEdit is a dual panel, containing the graph drawing area and the script area. )
  integrate it on the FileArea dialog, 
  Change the FileArea Model, so it can handles Graph files AND Script Files ( probably a Tree Model should be used, a parent saying 'Graphs' and all subitems of it are graphs, and another sayign 'Scripts', with all subitens as scripts.

3 - Integration with the Kross scripting Engine.
  This is really missing, rocs can draw beautiful graphs, but cannot interact yet with anything.
  the code for this is in src/engine folder.

4 - Calculate the Middle of the graph and fix the direction of all Loop-Nodes.
  they are currently drawned bottomright, always, it's not sexy or fluid.

5 - Expand the properties system for new properties. (there's a button to create, but it does not work yet.)

6 - Buttons and code for allignment. (gonna steal the code from the old version, it's almost the same).

7 - Animations on the nodes and edges. ( fade in when they are placed on the canvas, fade out when they are removed. )
  doesn't need to be a huge thing, but a small fade in is better on the eyes.

8 - 'Remove' button for removing nodes and edges.
